# virt-platform-autopilot TODO

This document tracks implementation progress against the original plan in `claude_assets/claude_plan.md`.

## Design Philosophy (from Plan)

**"Zero API Surface"** - No new CRDs, no API modifications, annotation-based control only.

**Key Principle**: ALL resources managed the same way using the **Patched Baseline Algorithm**:
1. Render asset template → Opinionated State
2. Apply user JSON patch from annotation (in-memory) → Modified State
3. Mask ignored fields from annotation → Effective Desired State
4. Drift detection via SSA dry-run
5. Anti-thrashing gate (token bucket)
6. Apply via Server-Side Apply
7. Record update for throttling

**User Control Annotations** (applies to ANY managed resource, including HCO):
- `platform.kubevirt.io/patch` - RFC 6902 JSON Patch for specific overrides
- `platform.kubevirt.io/ignore-fields` - RFC 6901 JSON Pointers for loose ownership
- `platform.kubevirt.io/mode: unmanaged` - Full opt-out

## Phase 2: Core Algorithm & User Overrides (Week 3-4) - ✅ COMPLETE

### ✅ User Override System (CRITICAL - Core Design Feature)

**Status**: ✅ Fully implemented and tested!

**Implemented packages**:
- [x] `pkg/overrides/jsonpatch.go` - RFC 6902 JSON Patch application
  - Uses github.com/evanphx/json-patch/v5
  - Applies patch to unstructured object in-memory
  - Comprehensive error handling for invalid patches
  - 14 unit tests covering all operations
- [x] `pkg/overrides/jsonpointer.go` - RFC 6901 JSON Pointer field masking
  - Parses comma-separated pointers from annotation
  - Extracts values from live object
  - Sets into desired object (operator yields control)

- ✅ Complete opt-out per resource (mode: unmanaged)

### ✅ Complete Patched Baseline Algorithm

**Status**: ✅ Fully implemented in pkg/engine/patcher.go!

**All 7 steps implemented**:
- [x] Step 1: Render asset template → Opinionated State

---

## Phase 3: Safety & Context-Awareness (Week 5-6) - ✅ COMPLETE

### ✅ Anti-Thrashing Protection (CRITICAL)

**Status**: ✅ Fully implemented and tested with pause-with-annotation enhancement!

**Implemented**:
- [x] `pkg/throttling/token_bucket.go` - Token bucket implementation (short-term protection)
  - Per-resource key tracking
  - Configurable capacity (default: 5 updates) and window (default: 1 minute)

- [x] Event recording for "Throttled" and "ThrashingDetected" events
- [x] Complete design documentation in `docs/anti-thrashing-design.md`

**Result**: Two-level protection preventing reconciliation storms with GitOps-friendly pause mechanism.

### ✅ Event Recording

**Status**: ✅ Fully implemented with comprehensive coverage!

**Implemented** (pkg/util/events.go):
- [x] Event helpers for all operator actions:
  - AssetApplied, AssetSkipped, ApplyFailed
  - DriftDetected, DriftCorrected
  - PatchApplied, InvalidPatch
  - Throttled (anti-thrashing)
  - CRDMissing, CRDDiscovered
  - UnmanagedMode
  - RenderFailed
  - ReconcileSucceeded
- [x] Integrated throughout Patcher reconciliation flow
- [x] 14 unit tests + 5 integration tests
- [x] Nil-safe (graceful degradation)

### ✅ Metrics & Alerting (✅ COMPLETE - Critical Observability Pillar)

**Status**: ✅ Fully implemented and tested! Complete observability stack with metrics, alerts, and runbooks.

**Context**: The operator doesn't use conditions or status reporting. **Metrics and alerts are the primary reporting and monitoring mechanism**, following "Silent when fine, precise when broken" philosophy.

**Metrics Infrastructure** (Commits: 55de367, 2e6ea6f):
- [x] `pkg/observability/metrics.go` - Custom metrics package (6 metrics)
  - virt_platform_compliance_status (Gauge) - Core health indicator (1=synced, 0=drifted/failed)
  - virt_platform_thrashing_total (Counter) - Anti-thrashing gate hits
  - virt_platform_customization_info (Gauge) - Intentional deviations tracking
  - virt_platform_missing_dependency (Gauge) - Missing CRD detection
  - virt_platform_reconcile_duration_seconds (Histogram) - Performance monitoring
  - virt_platform_tombstone_deletion_total (Counter) - Tombstone deletion tracking

- [x] `test/metrics_integration_test.go` - 17 integration scenarios
- [x] Instrumentation of reconciliation loop, throttler, CRD checker, tombstone deletion
  - pkg/engine/patcher.go - Compliance status, duration, customization tracking
  - pkg/util/crd_checker.go - Missing dependency metrics
  - pkg/engine/tombstone.go - Tombstone deletion metrics

**Alert Definitions** (Commits: bd0eedf, 8afeaf8, beb5572):
- [x] `assets/active/observability/prometheus-rules.yaml.tpl` - PrometheusRule with 4 alerts
  - VirtPlatformSyncFailed (Critical) - Asset failed >15min
  - VirtPlatformThrashingDetected (Warning) - Edit war detected (>5 events in 10min)
  - VirtPlatformDependencyMissing (Warning) - Optional CRD missing >5min
  - VirtPlatformTombstoneStuck (Warning) - Tombstone deletion stuck >30min
- [x] `test/promtool/alert_tests.yml` - Promtool unit tests for alert expressions
- [x] `test/prometheus_rules_test.go` - Integration tests with envtest
- [x] `hack/test-alert-rules.sh` - Smart test wrapper with auto-generation
- [x] Runbooks for each alert in `docs/runbooks/`
  - VirtPlatformSyncFailed.md - Sync failure diagnostics
  - VirtPlatformThrashingDetected.md - Edit war resolution
  - VirtPlatformDependencyMissing.md - Missing CRD guidance
  - VirtPlatformTombstoneStuck.md - Tombstone deletion troubleshooting
  - README.md - Index and quick diagnostic commands
- [x] CI integration - `make test-alerts` in lint workflow
- [x] Enhanced metric queries - Filtered output showing only problematic resources

**Test Coverage**: 39 observability tests (14 unit + 4 label + 17 integration + 4 alert structure)

**Why This Matters:**
- **Primary monitoring** - Metrics and alerts are how we report operator health (no status/conditions)

- **Proactive detection** - Catch thrashing, missing deps, performance issues
- **Production ready** - All alerts have detailed runbooks with troubleshooting procedures
- **Operator-friendly** - Filtered metric queries show only resources needing attention

### ✅ Soft Dependency Handling

**Implemented**:
- [x] `pkg/util/crd_checker.go` - CRD availability checker with caching
  - Checks if CRD exists before creating resources
  - 30-second cache TTL for performance
  - Component-to-CRD mapping
  - Cache invalidation support
- [x] Integrated into platform_controller.go
- [x] Logs warnings but doesn't fail reconciliation
- [x] Automatically skips assets for missing CRDs
- [x] Event recording for CRDMissing/CRDDiscovered

**Test scenarios covered**:
- [x] Asset creation with SSA (verify managedFields)
- [x] Drift detection (modify resource, verify reconciliation)
- [x] User patch annotation (apply JSON patch, verify override)
- [x] Ignore-fields annotation (user modifies field, verified operator doesn't revert)

- [x] Anti-thrashing (rapid updates trigger throttle)
- [x] Field ownership conflicts (operator vs user modifications)
- [x] Object adoption and GitOps labeling (3 tests)
- [x] Event recording during reconciliation (5 scenarios)
- [x] CRD soft dependencies and dynamic detection (6 scenarios)
- [ ] HCO golden config with user customization (future E2E)

- [x] Soft dependency handling ✅ **COMPLETE** (CRD checker with caching)
- [x] **>80% integration test coverage with envtest** ✅ **EXCEEDED** (80 integration tests, 0 flaky)

### ✅ Operational Goals - ACHIEVED
- [x] **Phase 1 Always assets deployed automatically** ✅ **COMPLETE** (8/8)
- [x] **Phase 1 Opt-in assets conditionally applied** ✅ **COMPLETE** (2/2)
- [ ] Phase 2/3 assets available ⏳ **DEFERRED** (VFIO, AAQ, node-maintenance, fence-agents, USB - advanced use cases)
- [x] **Users can customize via annotations** ✅ **COMPLETE**
- [x] **Users can exclude resources via root exclusion** ✅ **COMPLETE**
- [x] **Operator handles missing CRDs gracefully** ✅ **COMPLETE**
- [x] **Operator handles obsolete resources via tombstoning** ✅ **COMPLETE**
- [x] **Asset catalog matches plan scope for Phase 1** ✅ **COMPLETE**

### 📊 Current Status
**Phase 1**: ✅ 100% complete (all core features implemented)
**Phase 2**: ✅ 100% complete (user override system fully functional)
**Phase 3**: ✅ 100% complete (safety, events, soft dependencies, metrics, alerts)
**Phase 4**: ✅ 98% complete
  - ✅ Comprehensive testing (350 tests, 0 flaky, 3 skipped)
  - ✅ CRD automation (update-crds, verify-crds)
  - ✅ RBAC automation (generate-rbac, verify-rbac)
  - ✅ CI/CD infrastructure (lint, test, e2e, verify-generated)
  - ✅ Shell script quality (shellcheck)
  - ✅ Metrics infrastructure (5 metrics, 35 tests)
  - ✅ Alert definitions (PrometheusRule, promtool tests, runbooks, CI integration)
  - ❌ Documentation (user guides, architecture)

**Overall**: ~99% complete against original plan!

**Remaining high-value work**:
1. **User documentation** (adoption enablement - user guide, architecture docs, asset catalog)
2. **Phase 2/3 assets** (deferred - advanced/specialized use cases)

## 🎯 Next Steps

**Core platform is production-ready!** All critical features implemented and tested.

### Recommended Next Steps (Prioritized):

#### 1. **Write user documentation** (User Adoption - HIGHEST PRIORITY)
- [ ] `README.md` - Project overview, quick start, architecture summary
- [ ] `docs/user-guide.md` - Annotation-based customization guide
  - How to use `platform.kubevirt.io/patch`
  - How to use `platform.kubevirt.io/ignore-fields`
  - How to use `platform.kubevirt.io/mode: unmanaged`
  - Security considerations and limitations
- [ ] `docs/architecture.md` - Deep dive into Patched Baseline algorithm
  - Algorithm flow diagram
  - Reconciliation order explanation
  - HCO dual role (managed resource + config source)
- [ ] `docs/assets.md` - Asset catalog reference
  - All managed assets with descriptions
  - Conditions for each asset (hardware, feature gates, annotations)
  - Template variables available

#### 2. **Phase 2/3 asset templates** (Advanced use cases - LOWER PRIORITY)
**Phase 2** (Deferred):
- [ ] `assets/active/machine-config/04-vfio-assign.yaml.tpl` - VFIO device assignment
- [ ] `assets/active/operators/aaq.yaml.tpl` - Application Aware Quota
- [ ] `assets/active/operators/node-maintenance.yaml.tpl` - Node maintenance operator
- [ ] `assets/active/operators/fence-agents.yaml.tpl` - Fence agents remediation

**Phase 3** (Deferred):
- [ ] `assets/active/machine-config/05-usb-passthrough.yaml.tpl` - USB passthrough

### Why This Priority Order?

1. **Documentation** - Enable user adoption, critical for understanding the platform
2. **Phase 2/3 assets** - Advanced/specialized use cases, can be added incrementally

The platform now has all core differentiating features AND all Phase 1 production assets:
- ✅ Annotation-based user control (Zero API Surface)
- ✅ Root exclusion for Day 0 customization
- ✅ Tombstoning for safe resource lifecycle management
- ✅ Anti-thrashing protection (token bucket + pause-with-annotation)
- ✅ Complete Patched Baseline algorithm
- ✅ GitOps best practices (labeling, adoption)
- ✅ Comprehensive observability (events + metrics + alerts + runbooks)
- ✅ Debug endpoints and render command (operator transparency)
- ✅ Asset failure handling (error aggregation)
- ✅ Production-ready quality (350+ tests, 0 flaky, 3 skipped)
- ✅ Automated CRD management
- ✅ Automated RBAC generation
- ✅ CI/CD infrastructure with code quality gates
- ✅ Complete observability stack (6 metrics, 4 alerts, comprehensive runbooks)
- ✅ All Phase 1 assets implemented (8 always-on + 2 opt-in)
