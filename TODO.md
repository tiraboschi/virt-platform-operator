# virt-platform-operator TODO

This document tracks implementation progress against the original plan in `claude_assets/claude_plan.md`.

## Design Philosophy (from Plan)

**"Zero API Surface"** - No new CRDs, no API modifications, annotation-based control only.

**Key Principle**: ALL resources managed the same way using the **Patched Baseline Algorithm**:
1. Render asset template → Opinionated State
2. Apply user JSON patch from annotation (in-memory) → Modified State
3. Mask ignored fields from annotation → Effective Desired State
4. Drift detection via SSA dry-run
5. Anti-thrashing gate (token bucket)
6. Apply via Server-Side Apply
7. Record update for throttling

**User Control Annotations** (applies to ANY managed resource, including HCO):
- `platform.kubevirt.io/patch` - RFC 6902 JSON Patch for specific overrides
- `platform.kubevirt.io/ignore-fields` - RFC 6901 JSON Pointers for loose ownership
- `platform.kubevirt.io/mode: unmanaged` - Full opt-out

  - Current: Manual CRD collection
  - Nice to have: Automated fetching from upstream

---

## Phase 2: Core Algorithm & User Overrides (Week 3-4) - ✅ COMPLETE

### ✅ User Override System (CRITICAL - Core Design Feature)

**Status**: ✅ Fully implemented and tested!

**Implemented packages**:
- [x] `pkg/overrides/jsonpatch.go` - RFC 6902 JSON Patch application
  - Uses github.com/evanphx/json-patch/v5
  - Applies patch to unstructured object in-memory
  - Comprehensive error handling for invalid patches
  - 14 unit tests covering all operations
- [x] `pkg/overrides/jsonpointer.go` - RFC 6901 JSON Pointer field masking
  - Parses comma-separated pointers from annotation
  - Extracts values from live object
  - Sets into desired object (operator yields control)

---

## Phase 3: Safety & Context-Awareness (Week 5-6) - ✅ COMPLETE

### ✅ Anti-Thrashing Protection (CRITICAL)

**Status**: ✅ Fully implemented and tested!

**Implemented**:
- [x] `pkg/throttling/token_bucket.go` - Token bucket implementation

  - UnmanagedMode
  - RenderFailed
  - ReconcileSucceeded
- [x] Integrated throughout Patcher reconciliation flow
- [x] 14 unit tests + 5 integration tests
- [x] Nil-safe (graceful degradation)

### ✅ Soft Dependency Handling

**Status**: ✅ Comprehensive implementation!

**Implemented**:
- [x] `pkg/util/crd_checker.go` - CRD availability checker with caching
  - Checks if CRD exists before creating resources

### ❌ Phase 2 & 3 Asset Templates

**Phase 2 Assets** (from plan lines 437-441):
- [ ] assets/machine-config/04-vfio-assign.yaml.tpl (VFIO device assignment)
- [ ] assets/operators/aaq.yaml.tpl (AAQ quota operator)
- [ ] assets/operators/node-maintenance.yaml.tpl (Node maintenance operator)

---

## Phase 4: Build Tooling & Testing (Week 6+) - MOSTLY COMPLETE

### ⏳ RBAC Generation Tool (Next Priority)

**Status**: Not implemented. Role.yaml currently manually maintained (plan lines 712-717).

**Required**: cmd/rbac-gen/main.go
- [ ] Walk assets/ directory (exclude assets/crds/)
- [ ] Parse YAML/templates (replace {{ }} with dummy values)
- [ ] Extract GVKs from parsed resources
- [ ] Generate ClusterRole with exact permissions
- [ ] Output to config/rbac/role.yaml with "AUTO-GENERATED - DO NOT EDIT" header
- [ ] Integrate with Makefile (`make generate-rbac`)
- [ ] CI validation - Ensure generated RBAC matches committed version

**Why This Matters**:
- Eliminates manual RBAC maintenance as assets are added
- Ensures RBAC stays in sync with asset templates
- Reduces risk of permission gaps or over-permissioning
- Critical for scalability as asset library grows

### ✅ CRD Management (COMPLETE!)

**Status**: ✅ Fully automated CRD collection and verification!

- [x] Organize into assets/crds/ structure (kubevirt, openshift, remediation, operators, observability, oadp)
- [x] Update assets/crds/README.md with versions and sources (auto-generated)
- [x] Validate CRDs can be loaded by envtest (test/crd_test.go)
- [x] Makefile targets: `make update-crds`, `make verify-crds`
- [x] CI workflow: `.github/workflows/verify-crds.yml`
- [x] Verification mode: `hack/update-crds.sh --verify` (for CI)
- [x] Safety: Fetch to temp, only overwrite on success
- [x] CRD count tracking: 53 CRDs across 6 categories

**Features**:
- Automatic README generation with CRD sources and counts
- Verification mode for CI (detects outdated CRDs)
- Network failure resilience (keeps existing files if fetch fails)
- Comprehensive CRD collection for all managed resource types

### ✅ Testing Infrastructure (CRITICAL)

**Status**: ✅ Comprehensive test coverage achieved!

**Why envtest required**: Fake client doesn't implement SSA semantics correctly. Real API server needed for field ownership verification, managed fields tracking, drift detection, and user override conflicts.

**Implemented test files**:

- [x] Drift detection (modify resource, verify reconciliation)
- [x] User patch annotation (apply JSON patch, verify override)
- [x] Ignore-fields annotation (user modifies field, verified operator doesn't revert)
- [x] Unmanaged mode (resource ignored by operator)
- [x] Anti-thrashing (rapid updates trigger throttle)
- [x] Field ownership conflicts (operator vs user modifications)
- [x] Object adoption and GitOps labeling (3 tests)

---

## 🎯 Next Steps

**Core platform is production-ready!** All critical features implemented and tested.

### Recommended Next Steps (Prioritized):

#### 1. **RBAC Generation Tool** (Next Immediate Step - Automation)
**Goal**: Eliminate manual RBAC maintenance and ensure permissions stay in sync with assets.

**Implementation**: `cmd/rbac-gen/main.go`
- [ ] Asset scanner - Walk assets/ directory (exclude assets/crds/)
- [ ] Template parser - Handle .yaml.tpl files, replace {{ }} with dummy values for parsing
- [ ] GVK extractor - Parse YAML and extract GroupVersionKind from all resources
- [ ] ClusterRole generator - Create role with exact permissions for all discovered GVKs
- [ ] Auto-updater - Output to config/rbac/role.yaml with "AUTO-GENERATED - DO NOT EDIT" header
- [ ] Makefile integration - Add `make generate-rbac` target
- [ ] CI validation - Ensure generated RBAC matches committed version

**Why Now**:
- Asset library is growing (currently 8 assets, more planned)
- Manual RBAC maintenance doesn't scale
- Risk of permission gaps as new assets are added
- Automation enables faster asset development

#### 2. **Add missing asset templates** (Production Readiness)
**Phase 1 Always-On** (Missing 4/8):
- [ ] `assets/machine-config/02-pci-passthrough.yaml.tpl` - IOMMU for PCI passthrough
- [ ] `assets/machine-config/03-numa.yaml.tpl` - NUMA topology configuration
- [ ] `assets/kubelet/perf-settings.yaml.tpl` - nodeStatusMaxImages, maxPods tuning
- [ ] `assets/operators/mtv.yaml.tpl` - Migration Toolkit for Virtualization

**Phase 1 Opt-In** (Missing 1/2):
- [ ] `assets/kubelet/cpu-manager.yaml.tpl` - CPU manager for guaranteed CPU

**Phase 2** (All missing):
- [ ] `assets/machine-config/04-vfio-assign.yaml.tpl` - VFIO device assignment
- [ ] `assets/operators/aaq.yaml.tpl` - Application Aware Quota

- [ ] `assets/operators/fence-agents.yaml.tpl` - Fence agents remediation

**Phase 3**:
- [ ] `assets/machine-config/05-usb-passthrough.yaml.tpl` - USB passthrough

#### 3. **Write user documentation** (User Adoption)
- [ ] `README.md` - Project overview, quick start, architecture summary
- [ ] `docs/user-guide.md` - Annotation-based customization guide
  - How to use `platform.kubevirt.io/patch`
  - How to use `platform.kubevirt.io/ignore-fields`
  - How to use `platform.kubevirt.io/mode: unmanaged`
  - Security considerations and limitations
- [ ] `docs/architecture.md` - Deep dive into Patched Baseline algorithm
  - Algorithm flow diagram
  - Reconciliation order explanation
  - HCO dual role (managed resource + config source)
- [ ] `docs/assets.md` - Asset catalog reference
  - All managed assets with descriptions
  - Conditions for each asset (hardware, feature gates, annotations)
  - Template variables available

### Why This Priority Order?

1. **RBAC automation** (next immediate step) - Unblocks faster asset development
2. **Asset templates** - Enable production use cases (virtualization at scale)
3. **Documentation** - Enable user adoption and customization

The platform now has all core differentiating features:
