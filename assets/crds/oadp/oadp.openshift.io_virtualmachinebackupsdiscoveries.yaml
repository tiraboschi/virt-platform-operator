              observedGeneration:
                description: |-
                  ObservedGeneration represents the .metadata.generation that the status was set based upon.
                  For instance, if .metadata.generation is currently 12, but the .status.observedGeneration is 9,
                  the status is out of date with respect to the current state of the instance.

                  IMPORTANT: Controllers must set this at the START of reconciliation, not at the end.
                  This prevents race conditions where clients see updated conditions but stale observedGeneration.
